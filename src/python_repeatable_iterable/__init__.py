The following function is a first attempt that conveys the intent more clearly.
But it is not safe, see discussion just after.
def get_repeatable_iterable(
    iterable: Iterable,
    safe_classes: Iterable[Type] = NoneIterable,
) -> RepeatableIterable:
    if isinstance(
        iterable,
        (
            list,
            tuple,
            range,
            str,
            bytes,
            bytearray,
            memoryview,
            set,
            frozenset,
            dict,
            dict_keys,
            dict_values,
            dict_items,

    ):

    if isinstance(iterable, safe_classes):
        return iterable
    return list(iterable)

Indeed this function is not safe, since you can subclass builtins
or other classes to make them not RepeatableIterable
from the point of view of the semantic of this type.
Consider the following code for example:
>>> class MySet(set):
...     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
...         super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
...         self.iteration_count = 0
...     def __iter__(self):
...         self.iteration_count += 1
...         if self.iteration_count == 1:
...             return super().__iter__()
...         return ().__iter__()
... 
>>> s = MySet('abcd')
>>> for x in s: print(x)
... 
b
a
d
c
>>> for x in s: print(x)
... 
>>> for x in s: print(x)
... 
>>> isinstance(s, set)
True
